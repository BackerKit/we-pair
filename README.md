# What is this?

A list of companies that pair program, for job seekers.

# Why?

The goal of this list is to be a comprehensive resource for engineers around the world who want to find jobs where they can pair program.

Inspired by https://github.com/j-delaney/easy-application and https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards.
